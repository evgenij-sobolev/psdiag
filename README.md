# psdiag

PrestaShop (1.5, 1.6, 1.7) diagnostic tool.

## How to use
Copy this file (psdiag.php) to your PrestaShop root directory (where there are index.php, init.php and so on).
Run this script via web browser or from console.

Examples:
1) Run from browser: http://localhost/prestashop/psdiag.php
2) Run from console: php psdiag.php

First of all the PrestaShop diagnose should be done from a web browser because it is the web application.
